These are an informal collection of my rules to live by.

Embrace systems thinking as much as and where possible.

Systems exist to achieve goals. A system is a composable (very important) set of
tactics, procedures, and an existing knowledge base.

An attempt to reach a goal is for any system can be characterized as one full
pass through the system. Conversely, every failure is an opportunity to tune the
system to better meet the goal.

Embrace the two-minute rule. If I'm hesitant to do something, do it for two
minutes. If i still don't want to do it, then i need to postpone it.

The best way to understand is to write. This extends to ideas, thoughts, and
plans. Writing forces us to confront the pitfalls in our thinking.

A long walk always helps you think better. Avoid blank and unchanging
surroundings because entropy in the surroundings quells entropy inside your
head.

Abmition is goal-driven. Execution on achieving goals is system-driven. This is
why achieving ambitions is ultimately driven by the systems in place that help
you achieve your goals.

Automate whatever's possible to make start time minimal and reduce friction.

In an exchange, always try to be empathetic and understand the other party's
point of view.
