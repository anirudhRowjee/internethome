Welcome to my first travel log!

[Part 1 (you're here!)](/blog/experiences/dubai22-part1) |
[Part 2](/blog/experiences/dubai22-part2)

This is a recollection and a re-telling of my first trip abroad to Dubai, in
April 2022. My memories are somewhat hazy at the time of writing, but I've done
my best to create a standing archive of this time, so if I wish to, I'll be able
to look back at this, and bring myself back to this time.

It's an extremely eye-opening experience to see the world around you, and to
meet different people from different cultures, different walks of life, and
different lives, and see how they coexist together. Going on this trip showed me
so much about how people live, and how rich human cultures really are.

This post takes a visual approach to the art of storytelling, and to that end,
is filled with images.

The text you see in quotes -

> And by that, I mean, the text you'll see like this

Is taken directly from the log I wrote while I was there, at the end of each
day. The rest of it is text i've written while recollecting the time, with added
context.

## Day 0

We did leave a little earlier to ensure we had wriggle room if we needed some.
Thankfully, we reached on time, largely due to the Bengaluru Traffic gods
smiling down on us.

Checking in was surprisingly fast, with everything being A-Okay!

not make it to my instagram_

It was here I found out that Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru, also
has the sliding walkway (travelator? flat escalator? human conveyer belt? you
know what I mean)!

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xgXi0sc.jpg) _This! Picture taken as a screenshot
of a video_

Boarding went on very peacefully. The flight was for around four hours or so,
and I was intent on making the best use of this time to read some books, and to
relax.

That I did not end up reading is a blog post for another ten seconds of a
modern-day attention span, but for now, we solider on.

Soon enough, we got our food, and it wasn't half bad!

No comment. Airline food is sometimes nice.

It appears the lighting on the flight was designed to help impose a Circadian
Rhythm, and hence, simulated day and night.

> The lights in the plane were really cool, and the attendants were super
> polite! I managed to watch most of "No Way Home" on the flight.

Finally, we land in Dubai after four hours of lovely Emirates hospitality! I was
not prepared for what was to come.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/smadOmX.jpg) _My first view of Dubai on the ground_

Off the plane and into the airport we went. When I first set my eyes upon it, it
looked like I was living out a fever dream - bright, fluorescent white, Chrome,
and a small splash of bright colors. The vaulted ceilings and shiny reflections
everywhere really helped tie this together.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/q1rrr3D.jpg) _initial approach to immigration in
DXB_

The airport in itself is _huge_, to the point that an in-house subterranean rail
system is used to ferry passengers from one terminal to the other.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YfsuBOG.jpg) _The automated(?) train system moved
so fast that I was struggling for balance_

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hrbnRXr.jpg) _Nothing special, just a 120-person
elevator_

High ceilings, open areas, tons of white, chrome and neon white, combining to
make you feel like you're in a massive cavern of sorts, yet to be explored. The
central concourse had fast-moving LED Displays advertising Expo 2020, and
walking down the path, we were greeted by multiple folks, each hoping we'd
decide to stay at their hotel.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2OBYP7Q.jpg) _Central concourse at the DXB!_

Post immigration, we headed off to the baggage pickup, soaking in this amazing
environment. It took us a while to get used to how bright it was after the dim
calmness of the flight. We saw travellers from around the world here, and I did
my best to not get too lost in the sheer marvel of the place.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/twoWedj.jpg) _waiting for the luggage gods to give
us our bags_

We finally get our luggage, and find a cab to take us to our hotel. It was then
that I had my first introduction to the flat, speedy roads which I would later
appreciate. We cruised with confidence down the absolutely spotless roads,
pothole-free roads (can you tell where I'm from?) and though we arrived at
around 2 In the morning, there was still traffic!

We reached our hotel around 3AM, and began to look for the nearest place to eat.
Much to our surprise, we found plenty of places still open!

We checked in to the hotel the night before, and realized we had a rather large
room.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pR6Fiwn.jpg) _The corridor of our hotel_

We ended up eating typical Indian fare, deciding to delay the experimentation
for a couple of hours.

Per expectation, we came back and crashed into bed, the adrenaline of the new
setting having worn off a tiny bit.

## Day 1

> 10:47 IST\
> I've just woken up, and we're getting ready to leave, and visit the Dubai
> Frame. It's already hot - I keep my hand on the window pane, and the window
> pane is hot - and the humidity hits you like a blanket.

No kidding there, it was hot - however, not has hot was we expected! It was a
rather "pleasant" - higher 20s, lower 30s - so we didn't really need as much
sunscreen as we'd brought.

> 11:13 IST\
> I'm ready, and we'll be stepping out to check out the Dubai frame, which,
> supposedly, has the second-best view in all of Dubai - following which we'll
> be going to the Palm Jumeirah, where there's a lot more to see. We can have
> breakfast. I'm excited! It's still a little surreal that I'm in another
> country. It'll feel more real when I step out, is my guess.

We quickly finished breakfast, and decided to stay put for a while, planning out
the day and soaking in the atmosphere. (By Atmosphere, I mean the AC, but we
don't need to stress up on that).

> 1:06 IST\
> we got ready and decided to visit the monorail instead, as we were running
> late. The drive down the
> [E11 Road](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_11_road_(United_Arab_Emirates)>)
> road was scenic, with it looking a lot like a video game as opposed to real
> life. Buildings so tall you need to crane your neck to see the top, and the
> distance ever so lightly reducing the opacity - it was a sight to behold.

The road in question is also _Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Road_ and _Sheikh
Khalifa bin Zayed Road_, and what i've written about this road does little
justice to how grand and amazing it actually was.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/j2MpBHq.jpg) _On Approach from Old Dubai_

We had to get on a flyover, and once we were through, we went down an underpass.
The sights we saw as we emerged are still burnt into my brain.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jcmC1LL.jpg) _As you emerge, the heights of these
buildings will make you crane your neck as you attempt to see the top. They seem
to be incomprehensibly high up._

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pYrHD31.jpg) _Here's what you'll see a little ways
along - To the left, you'll see the **Museum of the Future**._

We continued to be awed by these buildings as we journeyed towards the Palm
Jumeirah, where we got off at the Monorail station. A brief escalator ride
later, we purchased our tickets, and were ready to travel on this famed train,
all the way to the Atlantis Dubai.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MioQ8Xy.jpg) _Entrance to the Monorail Station_

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OBxkd4K.jpg) _The view from the monorail station -

ticket counter_

> We then went on the monorail, which traversed the Palm. We saw all the fronds,
> but the only complaint was that the window mesh on the monorail spoiled the
> view :/

The view from the monorail as we zoomed along the main line of the Palm was
quite fascinating. You wouldn't be able to tell that you're on one of the
largest man-made islands in the world at all.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0i94Sp5.jpg) _The Burj Al-Arab, as seen through the
window mesh of the Monorail_

> the exorbitant prices, and took stock of all the stores around, including
> Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rYKTxOj.jpg) _The view near the entrance of the

> I took this picture there.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GibCIj5.jpg) _no difference, we're the same person_

> We also saw the attendants at the water park holding tridents.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/imgUx1x.jpg) _some of the wares on display for
purchase | Picture Credits - My Mom_

It was at this point that I decided that I saw (in hindsight, someone who looked
very similar to) Sergio Perez, Formula 1 Driver for Red Bull. They were decked
out in RBR Merch, so my brain saw it as the next logical conclusion.

> I could swear to god I saw Checo.

We then left, and hopped back on a cab. Since we had some time to spend, we
decided to go visit the Mall of The Emirates, one of Dubai's largest shopping
malls.

> On the way back, we decided to go to the Mall of the Emirates, which is HUGE.

Saying that the mall is large is an understatement, and it's something one needs
to experience to understand. There's no end in sight, and all around you are
stores for every possible thing you can dream of. We spend some time just
walking around the mall, soaking in the sights.

Hunger calls, and we have our first tryst with the food of Dubai. In a rather
anticlimactic turn of events, we chose to try out some Canadian food instead. We
look around and settle on Poutine, which is a Canadian staple consisting of
French Fries, Cheese Curds, and Gravy.

> 2:24 DST\
> My phone's on Dubai time now, and I'm in the Mall of the Emirates. We're
> eating Poutine at the food court!

We had two types of Poutine - I, in my purist approach, picked the Original
Poutine, while my sister chose to try a mexican variation of the same.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bMIgqXD.jpg) _Original Poutine_

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PHKrVSn.jpg) _Mexican Variant of Poutine_

While I knew that I shouldn't expect something familiar for the "Gravy"
component, exactly how different it was did somewhat surprise me. Sure enough,
My tryst with Cheese Curd, "Gravy" and French Fries ended on a ~~bittersweet~~
somewhat interesting-tasting note.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lel2grl.jpg) _The Roof at the Mall of The Emirates_

> As soon as we were done shopping in the mall, where everyone else spent a
> _lot_ of time at Carrefour, and I spent a lot of time at nearly every tech
> store i could visit.

Carrefour is one of the largest retailers of the world, with a significant
presence in the UAE. The stores are huge, and you'll find almost everything you
need (and then some) in a regular Carrefour. There's even a mini restaurant in
each one, so if hunger strikes, they're prepared to help you in that department
as well.

If you're visiting, be prepared to walk. A LOT.

> Carrefour had really nice discounts on some things, but nothing to the point
> that i'd pick buying it over here for. Also Carrefour is HUGE - easily three
> times the size of the main block of college. They had so many things over
> there.

I've been spoilt by deep discounting for my tech purchases, can you tell?

We then headed back to the hotel.

> Once we were done shopping, we took the Metro back to the hotel. It was super
> fast, and the view from the metro was AMAZING. Unfortunately it was also very
> crowded, so i didn't really get to enjoy it much, but it was still an amazing
> experience nonetheless.

The metro had amazing views of the City, as it travelled along the arterial E-11
road. It was well-organized, and we were able to get on to the metro directly
from the Mall.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qvBdDs1.jpg) _The Exit of the ADCB Metro Station_

> We got back and lazed around for a bit, and then we decided to go somewhere

> usually had to eat and drink.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/897q6qY.jpg) _Walking around, soaking in the
streets you don't usually see on youtube_

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rWfHDP2.jpg) _No dearth of supercars anywhere_

It turns out that the locals are mostly non-vegetarians, and finding vegetarian
food in Dubai is _hard_. We ended up walking around quite a lot to find a place
that had good, non-Indian vegetarian options.

> where we tasted authentic Lebanese food, and reaffirmed our love for Hummus.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Viumm9o.jpg) _The Mezzeh Platter, copius helpings

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qxgmMWE.jpg) _Khanafeh! Creamy enough to make you

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/e1pIsEj.jpg) _Some more sweets from the same place_

> Came back and slept.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Zri4FTW.jpg) _the view on the way back to the
hotel - it would make for a fine video game loading screen_

## Day 2

Better rested than we were before and ready to find some more interesting things
about this city, we set out yet again.

> Today started off with us thinking we'll visit the Dubai Frame. We stayed for
> a while and took pictures.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RMvefhx.jpg) _The Dubai Frame, which glows
beautifully in the light of the sunset_

I've heard the idea behind the Dubai Frame is that it's a monument to Dichotomy,
to both the old and the new sides of Dubai.

The frame is located at such a point that if you look at it from the Old Dubai
side, you'll see the New Dubai - Skyscrapers, Luxury, and Power - and vice
versa - Looking it at from the New Dubai side, you'll see the History, Culture
and Industry that Old Dubai represents. Both, however, are framed in Gold, and
that might just be the point to drive home.

> Once that was done, we went to the Dubai Mall, which is really, really,
> really, need-an-app-to-navigate large.

The app works excellently. The scale of the mall in itself is hard to take in at
first glance.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2IES866.jpg) _one of the many entrances to the
Dubai Mall_

> First we saw this huge, HUGE fountain, which really added to the depth of the
> place. It looked very serene, and very, very calm.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tBcZmkb.jpg) _A wide-angle shot of the fountain_

This fountain wraps around a good part of the lower few floors of the mall,
making it a sight to behold. The light glinted off the water, and the movement
made it really calm.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OTnskdl.jpg) _A close-up of the elements of the
fountain_

The mall is, understandably, the de-facto shopping location for luxury shopping.
Famous and exclusive brands were located as though they were mere stalls in this
giant complex, offering up each and every whim a shopaholic might have.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VehJgUk.jpg) _what's the secret?_

> We roamed around for a while, first stopping at Paul's Boulangerie to have
> croissants. They were nice, airy and light.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WPTyfzw.jpg) _can't really say no to these._

> Post this, we walked around rather aimlessly, just taking in the sights. I
> happened to glance upon a scale replica of an F1 Car, which I wasted no time
> in taking photos of. This was at the IWC Store, where they also had really
> cool suspensions of watch parts so you could easily see how each watch was
> built.

> We had lunch, and then we then went near the aquarium, where we saw so many
> different types of animals (sharks, manta ray, etc) and also noticed the
> "star-lit" roof of the mall.

We happened upon an extremely large candy store, which, for a while, made me
feel like a child in a candy store, which was exactly what it was. We also saw
someone make candy from scratch, which was extremely cool!

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TIh9cFC.jpg) _The wall of fish - this aquarium was
multiple floors large, and had a transparent tunnel where you could walk into
the tank!_

> where we ordered two slices of cheesecake. Both were decadent and sinful, each
> bite being absolutely to die for. We had the original '30th anniversary
> slice', and the 'Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake' as well.

This is easily some of the best cake I've had in my life.

definitely a very nice vibe!_

> We reached just in the nick of time and got on. We didn't have any of the food
> there, but the views were pretty nice!

We ran to reach the dock at Baniyas Road, which has a beautiful view.

> We had dinner, and then set off to roam the Gold Souk, which had a lot many
> more machinations of gold than I could imagine. Masks, dresses, even, made of
> gold. It was a little surreal.

This place is another one you _need_ to see if you're in Dubai. Shops on shops,
all dealing only with Gold and Silver - some with World Records to their name.
Somewhere, some Aurum Aficionado is having the time of their lives in this
street.

I hope you had fun! We'll see what happened next in Part 2, coming soon!
