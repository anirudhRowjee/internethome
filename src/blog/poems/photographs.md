# Photographs

A picture's worth a thousand words  
A singularity of feelings and thoughts  
Not a thing said and not a thing heard  
At a glimpse you connect unseen dots

Stories of lives punctuated by these  
In a vivid technicolor fantasy  
Funny moments recollected with ease  
What more do I need to see?

An awkward selfie, a "friendly" candid shot  
Archived for many seasons to come  
Hoarding them is a lucrative thought  
Due to a special reason for some

Strangely they somehow mirror at once  
Who I was and who I want to become  
If given a chance to go back, I don't know  
Just how many of those would come undone

Maybe somewhere between the remote control cars and the remote control TV  
We lost the smiles that once burned  
Brighter than a thousand suns at once, believe me  
Losing it, a privilege we felt we earned

Photographs are fantastic as they let us keep  
A little bit of ourselves in perpetual limbo  
Hold them, look inside and look deep  
I don't still feel like I'm him, though

Being able to capture these moments is a skill  
Just as it is to be able to ride a bicycle  
Clicking them is but an underrated thrill  
Slows the torrential downpour of thoughts to a trickle

So let yourself be captured on to both human and digital memory  
And you will recollect the good times with ease  
How, you ask? That's very simple  
Just say "cheese" :)
