# Bombay Dreams

As he dreams of movie award nominations\
his customers clamor for change\
a stark realization hits him\
he has run out of the smaller denominations\
and that the same can be said of his emotional range

who knows? the next instagram story or tiktok\
might be his claim to fame\
just a small man in a big city\
where survival is the name of the game

when he left his small town\
for a city street that was smaller still\
the ones who doubted him looked on with a frown\
but all he looked forward to was the glory - what a thrill!

because it was only those who looked the status quo in the eye\
and showed a middle finger to its face\
those that felt the need to try\
are granted entry to this highway of our rat race

his dreams manage to survive\
on crude yet powerful inspirations\
they propel his struggle to be known and to thrive,\
constantly grasping for what he hopes will be a poetic salvation

as he smashes puris with his fingers\
visualizing the box office records that are next\
it's hot blood that pumps and motivation that lingers\
giving him hope that those who doubted him will be left perplexed

at times he feels exhausted\
due to the blood, sweat and tears\
this feeling, like a microwave defrosts\
long-oppressed and deep rooted fears

It screams at him to pack his bags\
and get back on that train\
to leave the city of a million lights and many more stars\
to turn his dreams into mere sugar in the rain

but he promised his mother, and he promised his father\
that he would make a star of himself\
because living here in poverty would be better rather\
than stocking the factory shelves

one day, these efforts in fixed deposit\
will pay off if he bides his time\
those seeing him on screen will not be able to pause it\
enraptured by a performance so sublime

as the last customer leaves, he counts his earning\
they will keep him alive for another day or two\
but now it's time for him to let out the spirit, that is, from within, burning\
because to himself and the world it's the validity of the struggle he wants to
prove

the sun sets on another day\
of this man's expression of existence's struggles\
the innocent requests for more pani puri hardly see\
the second life that this man juggles
