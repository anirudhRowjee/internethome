# The Endless Hallway

A bucket of Consciousness\
and the mop of the mind's eye\
embark on this journey and peace is a mess\
why do I even try?

genesis. a warm bundle of joy\
a legacy of flesh and genes\
a tapestry of hugs and kisses\
no matter how limited the means

from pacifiers to bicycles\
nosebleeds born of the summer heat\
my friends and I and our beyblades\
undisputed kings of the street

yellow-orange streetlights and mosquite bites\
cast no shadows on these friendships\
the fun was silly but so were the fights\
all that remains now are faint blips

pockets filled with dreams and kaccha mango bite\
were now filled with worksheets and deadlines\
making the head heavy to keep the bags light\
a grand factory churning out dead minds

maturity. a confused scattering of obligations\
made us remember to forget\
childhood dreams born of a wild imagination\
promises never made, turned to regret

evening ceremonies and suits celebrate\
a kinship stronger than titanium\
will be see each other again? who knows?\
thoughts unexpressed by the music we hum

as i walk down this path\
technicolor memories on repeat\
my feet on the ground but my head in the past\
a streetlight without a street

i mop and sweep to keep moving\
for this corridor is mine\
a million eternities pass and a million more to go\
within the infinite confines of my mind.
