# Eternal Bliss

As you sit cross-legged on the muddy ground  
And inhale the cold mountain air  
There's silence, peace and not a soul around  
And the hands of the wind ruffle your hair

A still yet comforting peace descends  
Upon you as you look up and gaze  
The sight of a billion stars decorating the sky sends  
A lucid clarity through the haze

As you stare into the colorful nothingness, savoring  
Every little bit of this Technicolor explosion  
The void speaks back to you, the sky, all-knowing  
A grand yet graceful celestial force has spoken

On top of the world yet at the bottom of the universe  
Forces you to think of the larger questions  
What in truly infinite? Can time be reversed?  
Every mental errata a new direction

What are these mystic forces that so effortlessly  
Painted the sky above as through divinely inspired?  
Perhaps we haven't advanced far enough to fathom  
All that they have conspired;

It's strange that A riot of energy, entropy and color  
Provide such an unassuming calm  
The void and its energy match like no other  
Yet The night sky shall remain a soothing balm.
