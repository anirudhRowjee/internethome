Cold and crisp mountain air  
Lungfuls of clouds  
I wish i could keep seeing  
The greenery all around  

Unencumbered air  
Pure, crisp, and wet  
Descending and sinusoidal plantation floors  
As lush and full as could get  

The mist that slowly engulfs  
As if to hide the treasures that lie  
Moody and whimsical, sheltering playfully  
Look through and you'll see why  

Ethereal visions and eldritch forest horrors  
Invade this tranquil vision  
Giant beasts, silently moving  
At once destruction and precision  

Haunted engines that slowly prawl  
Growling to beat these lows and highs  
I must admit that I will regret  
The day that I eventually forget  
This oasis lost in time
