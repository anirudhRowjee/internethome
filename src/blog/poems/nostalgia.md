# Nostalgia

what could have been  
lost to the flow of time  
entire timelines wiped clean  
just because i chose mine

like a smoker fails to avoid  
just another whiff  
i cannot help but stop and wonder  
what if?

a different life  
but somehow the same person  
you begin to wonder whether it was you  
that changed or everything else

carbon-copy memories  
vivid as eyesight  
wayward phrases  
or tickets to a flight

they keep me up at night  
sleep a distant memory  
perhaps if i get nostalgic about sleep i will  
be rid of this malady

nor did i ask to be reminded  
of all my mistakes  
nor did i ask to suddenly understand  
what was real and what was fake "those were simpler times" we claim as though
we have failed to adapt
the problems are just as real and so is the pain  
we just abstract.

what does it feel like to feel  
seems like i forgot  
i just have to learn how to deal  
feelings are but a melting pot

let it simmer, what's another  
couple of years? my lone raft in the stormy seas at once  
facing all my worst fears - will i ever find a harbor?  
will i ever be free?

to reminisce is no crime, it is healthy  
in small doses - but when you recover moments  
that were once lost to the ocean of time  
it's not exactly a bed of roses

memories are ships that sail that  
sail this tempestuous sea, so when you  
come across a wreck remember that it is what once was but  
will never again be.
