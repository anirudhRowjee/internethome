the ground I stand on may be young  
but the sky, oh, the sky  
painted by the brush of time, infinite and vivid tapestry so hung  
is it any surprise we dream to fly?

a carefree dance with the sun so high  
spreading light and cheer to the world  
darkness, a silent, soft embrace  
how splendidly she glitters, has she been told?

technicolor paintings of galaxies long gone  
the eyes blessed to see  
no camera, no lens laid upon  
can tell these stories that one must see

a million colors and incomprehensible depth  
play tricks on my eyes  
the fabric of time, so mistakenly close  
the reach lost to a million tries

ever so slowly she sways  
a celestial movement unnoticed  
i am but an animal, living on a fast ball of stone and dirt  
in her sight, I come alive with awe and wonder  
but she will never know this

Words and structure fail me  
a man far too inferior to comprehend  
beauty, chaos, destruction and life, all I can see  
don't you agree with me, my friend?

The night sky, the epitome of grace  
she has seen all there is to see  
to truly understand how small we are, there is no better place  
all you must do is look up and breathe
