I like to drive and stick my hand out the window it is fun to let the wind push
my hand up and pull it down waving as though a boat in choppy waters

I am the one driving but I feel it is nice to let the wind take over a smooth
rhythm of ebbs and flows not a care in the world just the gentle lift and the
gentle push and the gentle fall

but I must remember that I am the one driving I am the one deciding what
happens. I am the one letting the wind take I am the one letting my hand go I am
the only one who can change it
