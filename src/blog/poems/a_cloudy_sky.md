# A Cloudy Sky

Oh, what flavors do thee possess  
That render you the source of all art  
In lucid observation, never failing to impress  
Justifying the whims of the heart

A hyperactive rainbow road  
Twists and turns till we're old  
Not ever constant, no single mode  
All seeking our pot of gold

As I observe the fragmented clouds  
But a reflection of my mind  
Thousands of people and a million crowds  
Is there ever one of a kind?

A gust of wind and a bout of thought  
Both pass over me in a flash  
Always seems like there's something I forgot  
Perhaps I have become too rash?

A lot can be learned from the horizon  
The tales of the dying light  
Processing all would lead to delirium  
Making me think of the "why"

Perhaps it is this that  
Binds us all together in sonder  
That life is not unique and unique is uniform  
Is a dangerous point to ponder

But what fun is an empirical perspective  
Without a piece of chalk in hand  
Our own uniqueness in the retrospective will  
Make us the lead of the band

It is in this and the struggle against it  
That the creatives find their home  
It is the encapsulation of all life and art  
That we will find ourselves known.
