# Feelings

When Keats spoke of the endless fountain\
Of immortal drink, pouring from heaven\
The venerable poet did misjudge the mountain\
Of emotions that does not let me sleep till 4 hours past 11

The human mind’s enigmatic machinations\
About its existence and mine\
Impose on me sudden and uncertain limitations\
Because five minutes ago, I was fine

My mind is the perfect accountant\
It keeps track of every loss\
Yet it seems to let slip the happiness and enjoyment\
Attributed (this behaviour) to the turbulence of a substandard boss

I feel I must reference some biblical proportions\
To accurately depict the scale of this malady\
However, no figure from these epics can address my consternations\
As time goes from steady drumbeat to a sickeningly fast rhapsody

Why must nature’s most powerful machine\
Fall prey to these small reactions\
Strong enough to set the scene\
And alter every interaction?

Sadness, the taloned bird of prey\
From within it consumes\
Regardless of how much I beg or how much I plead\
Inside me it creates a vacuum

Anxiety, the perennially runny nose\
A rather unnecessary roadblock\
We watch our mind beat itself up because it knows\
Something is likely to make the score drop

Happiness is like water, though\
Hard to grasp; satisfaction of a different breed\
Those who have swimming pools of it will never know just how much of it\
The ones holding out a glass really need

These feelings are like a circle\
With no beginning and no end\
We marvel in the absurdity of their sudden existence\
And in this lifetimes are spent

A feeling is but a neurochemical process\
With an unfortunately strong grip\
Uninhibited, like a dissatisfied spirit it will possess\
But being stable is the unfortunate crackle of the whip

Perhaps we are machines;\
Each of us uniformly random\
These feelings must be a flaw in our code\
Because we clearly aren’t equipped to withstand them

What else would explain the degree\
To which our lives change because of them\
I would rather not feel anything\
Than be an overfed caterpillar on this leafy stem.
