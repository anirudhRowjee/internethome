# Dauntless Mirth

Shut your eyes for a second\
and let the wind wash over your face\
hold tight, and come with, friend\
up the rainy hillside we race

The monsoon sky a scattered symphony\
of clouds and thunder and rain\
listen carefully, the order in the cacophony\
elixir to every plant and grain

let's lose ourselves in the trees\
and admire the grand canvas til dawn\
unbothered by who knows and who sees\
we are but stardust masquerading as celestial pawns

fly with the cotton-candy clouds\
and dance to the rhythm of the thunder\
it'll forever surprise me, how these sounds\
we took for granted make you wonder

run with me down the road not taken\
and let's lose ourselves in thought\
the madness for the mountains, once awakened\
won't let you remember what you forgot.
