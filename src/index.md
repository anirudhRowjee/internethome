### About Me

*Update*: I'm currently a Systems Engineering Intern at [Bytebeam](https://bytebeam.io/)!

I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at PES University, with a strong interest in Databases and Distributed Systems. I build [projects](/projects/) to understand the same. You can check out my tech side [here](/tech.html), and also look at my [proof of work](/proof_of_work.html) or my [github](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee).

I like writing (to myself, to people, for people), reading (scifi, thrillers, space operas, mystery), and playing guitar (acoustic). I also really enjoy travelling and meeting new people.

For an insight into what i'm currently up to and what sort of content I usually consume, check out the [gateway](/blog/gateway.html).

### About this Website

Fair warning - you _will_ find incomplete posts on this website. That's [by design](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).

Here's a [map of this website](/tags/index.html). There's no search, so feel free to use `Crtl+F` to do so - but in case you want a more curated exploration, here's the rough structure of this site -

- [technology](/tech.html) is a large part of my life - I see it as a means to bring about change in the world we live in.
- [travel](/travel.html) is arguably my favorite way to learn about nature, the world around me, and the human experience.
- [research](/research.html) is how I attempt to learn more about my field and answer some of the larger questions.
- [poetry](/poetry.html) is how I express myself. I write about things I like. This is an example.

The website you're reading right now is built with and generated by [Saaru](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee/saaru) - A Project i've been working on for a whilte now.
