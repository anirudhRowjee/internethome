## Meta

Fair warning - you _will_ find incomplete posts on this website. That's
[by design](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).

Here's a [map of this website](/tags/index.html). There's no search, so feel
free to use `Crtl+F` to do so - but in case you want a more curated exploration,
here's the rough structure of this site -

- [technology](/tech.html) is a large part of my life - I see it as a means to
  bring about change in the world we live in.
- [travel](/travel.html) is arguably my favorite way to learn about nature, the
  world around me, and the human experience.
- [research](/research.html) is how I attempt to learn more about my field and
  answer some of the larger questions.
- [poetry](/poetry.html) is how I express myself. I write about things I like.
- [talks](/talks.html) are how I share what I've learnt! I love doing talks, and
  I love introducing new ideas and watching people connect the dots even more.

The website you're reading right now is built with and generated by
[Saaru](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee/saaru) - A Bespoke Static Site
Generator written in Rust.
