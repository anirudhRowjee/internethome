The EES is an electronic election system built to make the process of School
Cabinet elections from a three-day, paper-intensive and manpower-intensive
process to a three-hour, zero-paper, parallel, stress-free process.

The EES is built on Django along with its inbuilt templating system, allowing
the users a hassle-free, easy-to-use experience on both the student and
administrator side.
