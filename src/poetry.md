> "We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for."  
> ~ John Keating, Dead Poet's Society

There's a lot to be said about how the meaning of the words we say changes purely based on the context it's present in. Poetry is the intersection of art, language, and rhythm, which I hope to express in my work.

Here's [my favorite poem of all time](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/157986/high-flight-627d3cfb1e9b7).
