> _"The Art of Teaching is the Art of Assisting Discovery"_\
> ~ Mark van Doren

I really, really like talking. It's the one thing I know how to do best, which
is to get up there and tell everyone what's on my mind - I've been doing it
since I was a kid, and I don't see any reason to stop.

I want to use this gift of mine to share ideas worth thinking and talking about,
and this page is a list of my attempts to share the same.

## 2023

### Presenting the "Time and Clocks" paper at Fireside by Homebrew @ HSP PESU ECC

There wasn't a slide deck for this one - just us getting at the paper directly,
because it's so, so well-written.
