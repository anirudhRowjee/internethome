I'm an engineer by trade and passion, so technology is a huge part of my life. You can check out my [projects](/projects/) and my [Proof of Work](/pow.html), but it's probably easier to check out my [Github](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee) to get an idea of exactly what I like doing.

Helping grow the tech community at a student level and establishing a culture of shared learning and knowledge-sharing is something I've been passionate about, which I've tried to establish through my time as the Founding Core Team Lead of [Hackerspace PESUECC](https://hsp-ec.xyz). I'm also passionate about FOSS and the FOSS Community, which I worked on through [Homebrew by HSP PESUECC](https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz).

## Interests

### Technologies

- _Distributed Systems_ - Endlessly fascinating. It's a wonder the internet works as well as it does.
- _Databases_ - these were always black boxes, so it's very interesting to peel back the covers and see that it's just really clever systems engineering all the way down.
- _Distributed Databases_ - Systems like CockroachDB, Cassandra, Dynamo, BigTable, F1 are all continuous sources of learning and inspiration for me.
- _CRDTs_ - [So cool](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/), and definitely the frontier for offline-first distributed systems
- _Kubernetes_ - Massive Orchestration at scale! The controller pattern is cool, and so is the declarative approach.

### Programming Languages

- _[Rust](/tags/rust)_ - My introduction to systems programming and my current favorite language.
- _[Golang](/tags/golang)_ - The concurrency model is very neat, and It's easy to write concurrent programs - I prefer golang for networked services / programs
- _[Python](/tags/python)_ - My first language, so I'm still somewhat fluent!
