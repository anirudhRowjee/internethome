I'm an engineer by trade and passion, so technology is a huge part of my life.
You can check out my [projects](/projects/) and my
[Proof of Work](/proof_of_work.html), but it's probably easier to check out my
[Github](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee) to get an idea of exactly what I like
doing.

Helping grow the tech community at a student level and establishing a culture of
shared learning and knowledge-sharing is something I've been passionate about,
which I've tried to establish through my time as the Founding Core Team Lead of
[Hackerspace PESUECC](https://hsp-ec.xyz). I'm also passionate about FOSS and
the FOSS Community, which I worked on through
[Homebrew by HSP PESUECC](https://homebrew.hsp-ec.xyz).

## Interests

### Technologies

- _Distributed Systems_ - Endlessly fascinating. It's a wonder the internet
  works as well as it does. Furthermore, consensus and maintaining data
  consistency in the face of high load and handling the inherent chaos of the
  real world is an extremely interesting part of distributed systems.
- _Databases_ - these were always black boxes, so it's very interesting to peel
  back the covers and see that it's just really clever systems engineering all
  the way down.
- _Distributed Databases_ - Systems like CockroachDB, Cassandra, Dynamo,
  BigTable, F1 are all continuous sources of learning and inspiration for me.
- _CRDTs_ -
  [So cool](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/),
  and definitely the frontier for offline-first distributed systems
- _Kubernetes_ - Massive Orchestration at scale! The controller pattern is cool,
  and so is the declarative approach.

### Programming Languages

- _[Rust](/tags/rust)_ - My introduction to systems programming and my current
  favorite language.
- _[Golang](/tags/golang)_ - The concurrency model is very neat, and It's easy
  to write concurrent programs - I prefer golang for networked services /
  programs
- _[Python](/tags/python)_ - My first language, so I'm still somewhat fluent!

## Why Databases / Distributed Systems?

Building the Electronic Election System really showed me how under-appreciated
databases are. It looks and is treated like magic, but under the hood it's all
just really clever engineering. Databases can scale to handle multiple thousands
of requests on a single computer, and they can do it without making things go
wrong.

The internet is the original distributed system; it's amazing to me that so many
different computers can co-ordinate to achieve a shared goal, and doing it fast
and well is a thing of beauty. My interest in distributed system started with
Blockchain, from facebook's Libra Coin paper. The concept of Byzantine Fault
Tolerance and how it withstood attacks on the network really fascinated me.

Eventually learning about Consensus along with the Raft Algorithm, and seeing
how database companies used these algorithms to make sure that their data stays
consistent in the face of extreme load and over hundreds or thousands of
computers, was and still remains a topic of massive interest to me.
