Hello! This is me. I have no clue what to write here.

I like writing (to myself, to people, for people), reading (scifi, thrillers,
space operas, mystery), and playing guitar (acoustic). I also really enjoy
travelling and meeting new people.

## Mission Statement

Still figuring it out. Aren't we all?

I believe that my biggest advantage is that I'm someone who is a jack of all
trades with strong competency in technology and leadership. I also have informal
experience with sales and door-to-door campaigning, giving me an edge with
regard to networking and outreach.

## Backstory

I started life as a child who was very interested in two things: 1) building
and 2) talking. My earliest memories of a computer are me messing around on a
really old PC that my dad brought home.

I've been tinkering with electronics, taking things apart and putting them back
together, from a very young age. This translated quite well to a budding passion
for robotics and working with Arduino when I was younger; I built plenty of
small things which I was really proud of.

As I started to get older, I started becoming the guy who took initiative. I
learnt how to code in school, and my friend
[Shreyas](https://www.kaundinya.dev/) and I built a lot of websites for the
school and for various projects. At the same time, I started to become extremely
interested in Debate, Public Speaking, and Model UN, and I took a break from
tech to pursue the same more seriously, and had a somewhat successful career
there.

## Why Tech?

This all changed sometime around the 11th grade, where, if not for my choosing
the science stream, I'd be studying to be a lawyer. Shreyas, Abhay, and I were
given the opportunity to attempt to automate our school's cabinet elections, and
us being us, volunteered to do it. In a herculean 1-month effort, we all learnt
Django, built out the system, deployed it with auth and multiple levels of
security, and managed to conduct the school's election with it, _taking a 3-week
paper-intensive process to a 3-hour paperless one._

> We do things not because they are easy but because we don't know how hard they
> are

In the process of building the Electronic Election System, I had to figure out
how to use the database schema design to let multiple students vote concurrently
and have multiple "polling booths" run voting in parallel. This was one of my
first, and arguably my most memorable, A-ha moment: staring at the
Entity-Relationship Diagram on the blackboard, I had my first taste of how
awesome the **database** was.

Ever since then, I've known that I want to be someone who solves problems with
technology, to make a positive impact on people's lives. It also happens to be
extremely fun :)

When I joined college, I realized that I find the idea of large-scale systems
very interesting. The sheer number of moving parts, how well they work together,
how well the abstractions mesh with each other, and how you can decompose a
large system into multiple smaller subsystems, all of these things fascinated
me.

I was also bitten by the bug of distributed systems after watching
[this talk](https://youtu.be/tV-WXM2IJ3U), and since then, Distributed Systems /
Dataflow Systems / Databases have held my interest in a chokehold. Reading the
[MapReduce Paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf)
was also a big tipping point that convinced me that these are the types of
problems that I find really cool, and the types of solutions that I find really
cool too.

## On Leadership

A huge part of taking initiative is getting it done; initiative has to be put to
use once it is taken. Throughout my life, I've been in leadership positions for
various things - House Captain and member of the School Cabinet, Head Delegate
and Trainer for the school's Competitive Model UN Delegation, and then in
college - Founding Club Head for [HSP PESUECC](https://hsp-ec.xyz), Co-Head of
MUNSoc PESUECC, Vice-Chair of ACM PESUECC, Tech Head for the college's cultural
fest, and most recently, a Lab Head (1 of 5) of the hallowed
[PES Innovation Lab](https://www.theinnovationlab.in/).

Each one of these experiences has taught me lessons that I will remain eternally
grateful for -

0. Conflict Resolution
1. Working in a team and setting ambitious goals
2. Building accountability and responsibility towards said goals
3. Understanding the effect of processes on how the work happens
4. Planning out and executing large-scale initiatives
5. Understanding and optimizing the division of work for maximum effect and
   quality

## About Me

I'm ~~currently~~ almost done studying Computer Science and Engineering at PES
University, with a strong interest in Databases and Distributed Systems. I build
[projects](/projects/) to understand the same. You can check out my tech side
[here](/tech.html), and also look at my [proof of work](/proof_of_work.html) or
my [github](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee).

## About this Website

Fair warning - you _will_ find incomplete posts on this website. That's
[by design](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).

Here's a [map of this website](/tags/index.html). There's no search, so feel
free to use `Crtl+F` to do so - but in case you want a more curated exploration,
here's the rough structure of this site -

- [technology](/tech.html) is a large part of my life - I see it as a means to
  bring about change in the world we live in.
- [travel](/travel.html) is arguably my favorite way to learn about nature, the
  world around me, and the human experience.
- [research](/research.html) is how I attempt to learn more about my field and
  answer some of the larger questions.
- [poetry](/poetry.html) is how I express myself. I write about things I like.
- [talks](/talks.html) are how I share what I've learnt! I love doing talks, and
  I love introducing new ideas and watching people connect the dots even more.

The website you're reading right now is built with and generated by

Generator written in Rust.
