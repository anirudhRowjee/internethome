## Proof of Work

I Value proof of work more than certifications or any other such credential or metric that can often fall prey to [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law). Along those lines, here's my proof of work, a comprehensive record of what I've been up to (also partially inspired by [Manas Saloi's POW](https://manassaloi.com/proofofwork/)).

Proofs appear in reverse chronological order.
