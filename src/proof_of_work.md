## Proof of Work

I Value proof of work more than certifications or any other such credential or
metric that can often fall prey to
[Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law). Along those
lines, here's my proof of work, a comprehensive record of what I've been up to
(also partially inspired by
[Manas Saloi's POW](https://manassaloi.com/proofofwork/)).

Proofs appear in reverse chronological order.

#### üõãÔ∏è Started an Internship at Couchbase!

Joined Couchbase as a Dev Intern.

#### Finished Capstone Project on Benchmarking Time-Series Databases for Observability Workloads

#### ‚è∞ Gave a Talk on Lamport's "Time and Clocks" paper at College

TODO Put Link\
This was pretty fun, and given how well-written the paper was, I didn't need any
slides to explain things.

#### üìù Presented a Paper at the Distributed Systems Reading Group

TODO Put Link\
I presented the Oakestra paper, which focusses on an alternative to Kubernetes
for the Edge.

#### üîç Gave a Talk on Vector Databases

TODO put slides\
This was pretty fun too.

#### ‚ö° Gave a Lightning Talk at GopherCon India 2023

Doing a completely unplanned Flash Talk turned out to be more fun than I
expected.

The talk was about how I used Raft to implement a clone of Kafka (with a
restricted subset of features) for a college project, bypassing an extremely
expensive zookeeper implementation to achieve better fault tolerance and lesser
manual supervision for scaling up and down.

#### üîÅ PESU Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Level 2 (Aug-Dec 2023)
